I am currently a Lecturer in Artificial Intelligence at the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh; and a Visiting Research Fellow in the Department of Informatics at King's College London. Prior to taking up my post, I was a Research Associate for two years at Kings. I was working on the CONSULT (Collaborative Mobile Decision Support for Managing Multiple Morbidities) project where I had the opportunity to collaborate with great people.

I am a member of Artificial Intelligence and its Applications Institute (AIAI).
I am a member of Security and Privacy group.
I am affiliated with Technology Usability Lab In Privacy and Security (TULiPS).

Please refer to my personal website for most up-to-date information. This is where I will share news, or I will make announcements when I am looking for students.
